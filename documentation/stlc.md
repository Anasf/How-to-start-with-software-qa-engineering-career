# STLC - Software Testing Life Cycle

- Series of steps or activities managed during the testing process to ensure that the quality goals are met by involving verification and validation.

- It is a method to check if our software product matches the expected requirements to have a defect-free product.

- Process of evaluation is the product is up to dates with requested requirements


*PURPOSE* - to identify errors, defects, gaps, or missing requirements compared to our expected requirements


*BENEFITS*: 
> a) cost-effective - better safe than sorry

> b) security - prevents possible breaches within the defects

> c) product quality

> d) customer's satisfaction


## Types of Software Testing:

- Functional testing (Unit testing): testing individual units or components to get confirmation that each unit works properly

- Integration: Software units integrated and tested as a group

- Non-Functional testing (Performance, Endurance, Load, Volume, Usability)

- Maintenance (Software) testing: completed as a whole and mostly check security, functionality, and portability


## Types of testing techniques:

1. White box testing - Code is visible to testers what causes the name - internal structure, design, and coding software are tested to verify and improve security, usability,  and design

2. Black Box testing - without knowing an internal code - testing functionalities of software applications

3. Gray Box testing - Combination of the first two where it is possible to test both sides of an application, presentation as well as the code part.



## 7 Principles of software testing

1. Exhaustive testing - not an option (needing the optimal amount of testing based on a risk assessment)

2. Defect clustering - theory how small amounts of modules/units can contain most of the defects

3. Pesticide paradox - If the same set of repetitive tests are conducted, the method will be useless for discovering new defects (to overcome this issue, test cases need to be review and revised)

4. Testing shows the presence of defects - reduces the chances of having undiscovered defects

5. Absence of error - even if a system is 99% bug-free, it still can be unusable (looking for the wrong requirements)

6. Early testing - Should start testing as soon as possible with the purpose of getting the defects in early stage

7. Testing is context-depended - need to know what are the test plans and what we are searching for to get the best met of requirements
